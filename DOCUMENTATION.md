# Inspiration

## Marla
- I think the color scheme is excellent! It is creative, and I also find it to be uplifting and inviting. I was going to suggest incorporating some **green**, **yellow**, and **bright blue**, even if we **used UNLV colors as the primary color scheme**. It thought details here and there of those colors could **warm and brighten the red / grey / white**. I really like the **white and greens**, with some **grey accents** here! That actually achieves what I was looking for while thinking of **green / yellow / blue**. But I have included some stock images reflecting what I was thinking here, in case a background photo is needed.
- I also suggest adding an **exclamation point after the title**: Welcome to Promoviendo!
- Having a student make the logo sounds great! We could give them inspiring images, such as **two hands**, **a sun**, etc. If phenotypic images are included, I suggest they be **Brown to reflect the Hispanic / Latinx community**.
- Here is my bio: Marla Goins (she / ella / ela), PhD, is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Teaching and Learning at University of Nevada, Las Vegas. She studies the histories and teaching strategies of educators in the United States and abroad - namely Brazil. She strives to foster equity for historically marginalized students.
- We might also incorporate some **key inspirational quotes from computer scientists of Color or researchers in critical education**. This could be quotes from the work that we end use for our programing and research, as I believe this also helps visitors to the website to gain more understanding of our work.
